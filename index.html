                <h2>History of Keukenhof</h2>
                <p>The history of Keukenhof dates back to the 15th century. Countess Jacoba van Beieren [Jacqueline of Bavaria] (1401-1436) gathered fruit and vegetables from the Keukenduin [kitchen dunes] for the kitchen of Teylingen Castle. Keukenhof Castle was built in 1641 and the estate grew to encompass an area of over 200 hectares.</p>

                <p>Landscape architects Jan David Zocher and his son Louis Paul Zocher, who also designed Amsterdam's Vondelpark, redesigned the castle gardens in 1857. That park, in the English landscape style, still constitutes the basis of Keukenhof. </p>

                <p>In 1949 a group of 20 leading flower bulb growers and exporters came up with the plan to use the estate to exhibit spring-flowering bulbs, signaling the birth of Keukenhof as a spring park. The park opened its gates to the public in 1950 and was an instant success, with 236,000 visitors in the first year alone. 2022 will be the 73th edition of Keukenhof. During the past 72 years Keukenhof developed into a world-famous attraction. </p>

                    <h2>FAQ</h2>

                    
                    <h4 >When is the best time to visit Keukenhof? </h4>
                     <p class="faq_ans"> Flowering at Keukenhof parallels that in nature. The crocuses, daffodils, hyacinths and early tulips flower at the start of the season. Other flowers bloom later in the season such as the (larger) tulips. It is less busy before 10:30 and after 16:00. It is also less busy on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday than on the other days of the week.</p>

                    <h4>Can I bring my own food and drinks?  </h4>
                      <p class="faq_ans">Yes, you may bring your own food and drinks. You may not eat or drink your own food or beverages in the restaurants.</p>

                    <h4>Are dogs allowed in the park?  </h4>
                      <p class="faq_ans">Dogs are allowed into Keukenhof as long as they are on a leash and there is a maximum of 1 dog per person. Dogs are not allowed into the pavilions or restaurants with the exception of guide or support dogs. Dog excrement bags are available free of charge at the ticket entrance.</p>


                    <h4>I lost an item at Keukenhof. Did you find it?  </h4>
                      <p class="faq_ans">We collect all lost items and post them in iLost. <a href ="https://ilost.co/org/keukenhof?utm_source=keukenhof&utm_medium=widget&utm_campaign=searchbox_widget&q=" target="_blank">Click here</a> to see if your item has been found.</p>


                    <h4>May I stroll through the bulb fields? </h4>
                      <p class="faq_ans">No. You may not walk through the bulb fields as this damages the bulbs. The fields are also the private property of the bulb growers. You are permitted to take photographs from the road.</p>
